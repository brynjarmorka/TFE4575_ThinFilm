\subsection{Sample storage}
\label{sec:sample-storage}
\noindent The BTO sample was made during one session, stored in the toolbox for the course, and then characterized in a second session.
The synthesis was done on the 27th of September, and the sample was characterized on the 11th of October.
Unfortunately, the one-inch plastic sample box somehow opened during storage, and the sample was laying loose in the toolbox when it was taken out to be characterized.




\subsection{Optical Images}

test

\noindent Two images were obtained using an optical microscope.
First, a 5X magnification overview image was taken of one sample corner.
The result of this can be seen in \autoref{fig:optical_overview}.
Then, a 20X magnification image was taken of the middle of the sample.
The result of this can be seen in \autoref{fig:optical_20x}.

% profilometer

\subsection{Profilometer}
\label{results:profilometer}

The profilometer data was acquired at three different locations on the sample.
The data is presented in \autoref{tab:profilometer} and \autoref{fig:profilometer}.
The only data processing done was flattening the data on the instrument computer, and later centering the data around zero, to make the data more comparable.

        Q1 and Q3 are the first and third quartile, respectively.

% SEM
\subsection{SEM images}
\label{results:SEM}

SEM images were acquired on the SEM APREO at NTNU NanoLab, without coating of the sample.
One of the engineers at NanoLab suggested that the sample would be conductive enough, and showed examples of SEM results from other ferroelectric thin films that were not coated, e.g. \cite{hunnestad_visualizing_2019}.
The examples used low voltage and low current, which was also used in this work.
The thickness of the film was only measured at the edge.

% SEM image of the corner
\autoref{fig:sem_high_res} shows an overview SEM image of a corner, which is the same area in the optical image in \autoref{fig:optical_overview}.
The image was taken with 3 kV and 50 pA, using the EDT detector to get both topography and z-contrast.
The scale bar is 250 \textmu m.

% SEM image of what might be pores
\autoref{fig:sem_overview} shows a closer SEM image of a part of the sample.
The image was taken with 5 kV and 0.1 nA, using the T2 SE detector, thus getting only topography contrast.
The scale bar is 5 \textmu m.
This image is of the edge, which is visible in the lower left corner.
Here the thickness is measured to be 670 nm, when assumed that the BTO thin film is only the darker top layer.

% SEM image of artifact which is 10 um long
\autoref{fig:sem_artifact} shows a close up SEM image of an artifact which is 15 \textmu m long and 5 \textmu m wide.
The image was taken with 5 kV and 0.1 nA, using the T2 SE detector, thus getting only topography contrast.
The scale bar is 10 \textmu m.
