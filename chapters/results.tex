\section{SEM images}
\label{results:SEM}

SEM images were acquired on the SEM APREO at NTNU NanoLab, without coating of the sample.
One of the engineers at NanoLab suggested that the sample would be conductive enough, and showed examples of SEM results from other ferroelectric thin films that were not coated, e.g. \cite{hunnestad_visualizing_2019}.
The examples used low voltage and low current, which was also used in this work.


% SEM image of the corner
Figure \cref{fig:sem:corner} shows an overview SEM image of a corner, which is the same area in the optical image in \cref{fig:optical:corner}.
The image was taken with 3 kV and 50 pA, using the EDT detector to get both topography and z-contrast.
The scale bar is 500 $\mu$m.


% SEM image of what might be pores
Figure \cref{fig:sem:pores} shows a closer SEM image of a part of the sample, which is the same area in the optical image in \cref{fig:optical:pores}.
